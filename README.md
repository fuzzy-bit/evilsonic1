# S1 Engine Test
Known issues:
- Graphics for signpost don't load if you die
- Sprite priority is not reset on respawn
- Music can be weird, experimental sound driver
- Camera or tiles act up on respawn
- Level events get triggered again after death
- Sound test is broken
- Drowning softlocks the game, doesn't restart level music
- Songs are in a weird order
- Music fades out when it's supposed to stop, and vice versa

Maybe objects should reset on respawn due to how broken it is in MZ. I don't know.
