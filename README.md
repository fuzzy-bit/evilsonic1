# BrutalSonic
A violent Sonic 1 hack.

## Things that should be implemented before release

- Red screen flash on death
- Tint water palette red when Sonic dies in water (Without drowning)
- ~~S3K sprite format~~
- S3K art
- Dynamic death sprites
    - Detect what direction Sonic was crushed from
    - Slight flinging
    - ~~Art~~
- Blood stain object
    - Stain sprites + mappings
- Blood particles
    - MK (Default)
    - Hedgehog Abuse
- Sonic gets cut in half with saws
- Difficulty levels
    - Easy (Regular S1 behavior without spike bug)
    - Normal (Default - bouncing projectiles)
    - Hard (Bouncing projectiles, spike bug, no rings in bosses)
    - Nightmare (Hard + no rings)
- Menu
    - Option descriptions (For difficulty, make it describe the mode)

- Custom levels if possible
- Mogeko easter egg level
    - Activated in a hidden crevace within Marble Zone, just enough for Sonic to roll into, not accidentally. One pixel tile difference.
    - Endurance mode, ~5 minute timer
    - When killing a Mogeko, flash screen and use blood object the same way Sonic does when dead
    - If Sonic dies to a Mogeko, play the crunching sound from the original game (usually used when Yonaka is being hurt)
    - Unlocks "Fan Mode" when beaten (see: experimental/fan-disasm)
- Splash screens
    - New SEGA screen
    - Fuzzy presents
