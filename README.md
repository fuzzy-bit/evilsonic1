# BrutalSonic
A violent Sonic 1 hack.

"It was made so something like THIS could happen."

## Things that should be implemented before release
- ~~Refactored Sonic 1 engine~~
- ~~Red screen flash on death~~
- Tint water palette red when Sonic dies in water (Without drowning)
- ~~S3K sprite format~~
- ~~S3K art~~
- Dynamic death sprites
    - Detect what direction Sonic was crushed from, or randomize (depending on how much time is left)
    - Sonic gets cut in half with saws
    - Slight flinging
    - ~~Art~~
- ~~Blood stain object~~
    - ~~Stain sprites + mappings~~
- ~~Blood particles~~
- Difficulty levels
    - ~~Easy (Regular S1 behavior without spike bug)~~
    - ~~Normal (Default - spike bug + bouncing projectiles)~~
    - Hard (Bouncing projectiles, spike bug, no rings in bosses)
    - Nightmare (Hard + no rings)
- Menu
    - Option descriptions (For difficulty, make it describe the mode)
    - Difficulty Select
    - Blood particle style
    - Sound test
    - Exit
- Saving options and data with SRAM
- ~~Projectiles~~
    - ~~Crabmeat~~
    - ~~Buzzbomber~~
- New bosses
    - Green Hill
    - Marble
    - Spring Yard
    - ~~Star Light~~
- ~~No boss in labyrinth~~
- ~~DMA Queue~~
- Custom levels
- Mogeko easter egg level
    - ~~The Mogeko enemy itself~~
    - Activated in a hidden crevace within Marble Zone, just enough for Sonic to roll into, not accidentally. One pixel tile difference.
    - Endurance mode, ~5 minute timer
    - When killing a Mogeko, flash screen and use blood object the same way Sonic does when dead
    - If Sonic dies to a Mogeko, play the crunching sound from the original game (usually used when Yonaka is being hurt)
    - Unlocks "Fan Mode" when beaten (see: experimental/fan-disasm)
    - Going to the hidden spot with "Fan Mode" enabled, it will bring you to another easter egg...
- Splash screens
    - Warning (Appears once, or if SRAM is not present)
    - ~~New SEGA screen~~
    - Sonic Retro
    - Fuzzy presents
